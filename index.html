            <p>It conatin an array of user [] that will be show to the user
                <ul>It is simply state mangment container</ul>
                <ul>we can keep track of all our components state</ul>
                <ul>If we want to pass Props to Differnt Component we have to lift the state of component and pass as a props to another component</ul>
                <ul>It Make application more complex</ul>
            </p>

            <h6 class="int">Detail</h6>
            <p>why we use Redux
                <ul>In an application if we want to pass Data to serverL components and in different Layers we simpley have to pass Data as a Props to Parent components That make if complex and Difficult </ul>
                <ul>By using Redux we can pas the components in which we want to pass Props and change the State </ul>
                <ul>It make Life more Eaxy</ul>

            <h6 class="int">Start Redux</h6>
            <p>How to start redux app 
                <ul>Creat a folder go inside the folder and Open Terminat and type <span>npm init --yes</span> </ul>
                <ul>It will creat local file which will show the .json file which show dependincy</ul>
                <ul>Now type <span>npm install redux</span></ul>
                <ul>Now creat a <span>Index.js file</span> in the folder</ul>

            <h6 class="int">3 Concepts</h6>
            <p>3 Main concepts
                <ul><span>Store</span> Hold the state of an application</ul>
                <ul><span>Action</span>Desribe what will happen when state will change</ul>
                <ul><span>Reducer</span>It Ties the store and Action together</ul>

        <h1>Three Main Principle</h1>
        <p>
            <span>1st Principle</span>
            <ul>The state of whole application is store in a single object which will be manage by the Redux store </ul>
             <span>2nd Principle</span>
             <ul>The only way to change state is by emiting action an object descript what happens</ul>
             <ul>To update state you need to let redux know about with an action</ul>
             <ul>Not allow to update state object directly</ul>
             <span>3rd Principle</span>
             <ul>To update state write pure  Reducer</ul>
             <ul>To specify how the state will transfer by action write your Reducer</ul>
             <ul> <span> Reducer (preState + Action)=> newState   </span>
             </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>Action</h1>
        <p><ul>An action is an Object with type properties and Action Creator is an function that return the function</ul>
        <ul>Type property indicate the action to be perform</ul></p>
            <h1>Reducer</h1>
            <p><ul>
                It specify how app change or responce to action sent to redux store
            </ul>
            <ul>Function that accept state and argument and return the next state of application</ul>
            <ul>(prevActin,State)=>newState</ul>
        </p>

            <h1>Redux Store</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>It Hold Application state</ul>
                <ul>Allow Access to getState (state)  </ul>
                <ul>Allow acces to update state and regester listner</ul>
                <ul>Also Handal unregester  of listner the function return by  subscriber</ul>
            </p>

            <h1>Multiple Reducer in App</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>we can use multiple Reducer in our app </ul>
                <ul>If we use single state reducer ity will Quite complex to handle for us sowe use multiple reducer </ul>
                <ul>we can create differenr reducer in differnt reducer file make their logic it will make our life easy</ul>
            </p>
            <h1>Middleware</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>It is used to add custom functionality in Redux</ul>
                <ul>Provider a thired party extension between  dispatch action  </ul>
                <ul>It is also used for LOGGING, CRASH REPOTING, PERFORMING ASCRONHING TASK</ul>
                <ul>Install it form <span>npm install redux-logger</span></ul>
                <ul>use the redux-logger functions and creat logger</ul>
                <ul> we will import redux-logger and craet a logger in our app and define it at the top of app and user it in redux-store applyMiddleware and pass logger as a propas
                     it will give us all detail of logg and change in the state</ul>
            </p>
            <h1>Action</h1>
            <p> 
                <ul>As soon  action is dispatch that state will  immmedatly update  </ul>
                <ul>It have several components</ul>
            </p>
            <h1>State</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>satete is an object with several properties</ul>
                <ul><span>Loading</span>Display spinner for our app and is set true</ul>
                <ul><span>Data</span>List of users  an is an empty array</ul>
                <ul><span>Error</span>Dispaly Error is api call is fail our something else</ul>

            </p>
            <h1>Action</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>Fetch-User-Request : Fetch list of users</ul>
                <ul><span>Fetch-User-Success</span>Fetch succesfull</ul>
                <ul><span>Fetch-User-failer</span>Error in  fetch Data</ul>

                
            </p>


            <h1>Reducer</h1>
                <p>
                    <ul>Now we will set Logic for this all    </ul>
                </p>
                <button>use this all in react app </button>
